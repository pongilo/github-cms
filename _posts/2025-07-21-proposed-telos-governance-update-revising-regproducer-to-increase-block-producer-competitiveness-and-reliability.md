In an effort to increase block producer competitiveness and performance on Telos, Detroit Ledger Technologies block producer (eosiodetroit) is excited to announce the first in a series of proposed improvements to the Telos Blockchain Network Core Governance documents.

# **Regproducer Clause 7: Resignation and Removal for Inability to Perform Obligations**

This proposed change is a small but powerful change that defines the penalty for failing to produce 15% or more of the assigned blocks within a rotation in the “regproducer” agreement that all block producers sign when they register on Telos Zero mainnet. This represents approximately 30 minutes of active block production time or approximately 2 hours of consecutive time the block producer is out of service. Unlike many of the other clauses for violations of block producer duties and acts of intentional malicious behavior, Clause 7 neglects to prescribe a penalty and was inserted into the code without much data on what the appropriate service level should be at the time. Raising and aligning the standard will increase competition among block producers. Staking additional tokens to REX requires users requires users vote for registered block producers, meaning users may miss out on valuable yield if they do not adjust their votes.

The current penalty is a 2 hour violation for the initial offense, raised by a power of two per offense. For example, a second violation is 4 hours, a third violation is 8 hours, a fourth is 16 hours, and so on. Under this system, the initial penalties do not reflect the appropriate severity for poor performance that has network-wide implications. Penalties can also become unsustainable over the course of years. For instance, 2 to the 12th power is a 4096 hour penalty or approximately half a year, which if the 12 violations happen over 5 years is a reasonable amount of offenses especially when Telos becomes more difficult to run because of increased usage.

# **Community Sentiment**

Based on polling of the Telos community in Telegram, the results favored increasing the penalty to one week, with an additional one week increase per offense within the previous 6 months. The raw results of the poll are as follows:
