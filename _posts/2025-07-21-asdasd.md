title: How to Create a Telos Governance Proposal the Easy Way!
---
Telos Decide is the governance engine that powers the voting and decision-making process on the Telos Blockchain. It provides a user-friendly interface for creating, submitting, and managing governance proposals, called Telos Amend. In this section, we’ll walk you through the specific steps to use Telos Amend to propose changes to an **existing** Telos network governance document.

# **1\. Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

*   **A Telos Zero Account and Wallet**: You must have a Telos Zero account. At this time, only Telos Zero accounts can create and vote on governance proposals.
    
*   **Stake TLOS Tokens**: You’ll need a small amount of TLOS tokens in your Telos Zero account to stake for network resources and to pay a fee for creating the proposal (to prevent network spam). Tokens can be purchased from a variety of exchanges or bridged from your TelosEVM account to your Telos Zero account using Telos Wallet.
    

These two steps can be achieved by following the official Telos guide found [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m92qf5osTqw) You may need to purchase additional TLOS tokens which can be done through [Uphold](http://uphold.com/), [Kucoin](http://kucoin.com/), or a DEX like [Swapsicle](http://swapsicle.io/).
